<!-- 注意：在使用负的 z-index 来把一个子元素移动到它的父元素下层时，
            请务必小心：如果父元素的上级元素有背景，则该子元素将出现在它们之后。
     这一点应该是这个实现毛玻璃的一个限制，当背景不是用在body，而是其他元素的时候，
             body又有自己的背景色的话，毛玻璃也是实现不了

What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain...
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
What have we done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son...
What about flowering fields
Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores
